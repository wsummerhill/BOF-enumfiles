# BOF-enumfiles
C++ implementation of a BOF to quickly enumerate local files of interest for post-exploitation. Useful to help find potential LOLbins, remoting software, browser or web server installations, etc.<br />

Kind of a dumb script, just meant to quickly automate enumeration for post-exploitation, and to learn C++ BOF dev using the newer Visual Studio  [Cobalt Strike templates](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/bof-vs).<br />

The BOF will only print out any files/folders found during enumeration and otherwise be silent. It also requires the `%APPDATA%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, and `%WINDIR%` environment variables for file enumeration.<br />

## Commands Usage
This BOF contains the following commands:
